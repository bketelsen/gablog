On [[http://blog.gopheracademy.com/day-09-building-a-weather-app-using-go][day 9]] it was [[https://twitter.com/goinggodotnet][William Kennedy]]'s turn to explain how he launched [[https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/outcast-noaa-radar-hourly/id739808997?mt=8][Outcast]], an iOS application, using a backend powered entirely by Go.

On [[http://blog.gopheracademy.com/day-18-go-outside][day 18]] Tony Wilson instructed us all to Go Outside. This is always good advice, and in this case in particular, extremely useful if you need to call functions in shared objects (or DLLs) from Go.

Thank you to all of you for contributing your articles, time, and experiences about using Go in the real world.
